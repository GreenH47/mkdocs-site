# How to use the FIT study Note document
1. download the [markdown file repository](https://github.com/GreenH47/mynote) and  navigate to the `docs` folder
2. view all the markdown files via [Obsidian vault](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Working+with+multiple+vaults) that can show the linked section in the note document  ![](img/5032-20221103.png)  
3. You may find some extra material or program template  repository in the Course Brief introduction for the FIT Note markdown Document (some course don't have )

4. you can view [the web page](https://greenh47.github.io/mynote/) which transfer from MD file online but will lose the extra information or wrong    markdown display

[This repository](https://github.com/GreenH47/FIT5032_2022s2) contents weekly task and my assignment template for [FIT5032 - Internet Application Development](https://handbook.monash.edu/2022/units/FIT5032?year=2022) done for the year 2022. (Semester 2)  

Solutions are working out of the box. (Due to the nature of this unit)  
You can run the project by running the .mdf files which are intentionally in the repository so that it would be working. (some parts are hidden for safety but not influence the framework working)
# week 1 MVC & ASP .net
## Lecture Note
+ Introduction to Internet Applications Development
+ Understand the purpose of ASP.NET MVC
+ Understand the benefits of the MVC architecture
## Q&A part
### ★what is MVC
+ The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern separates an application into three main groups of components: Models, Views, and Controllers
![](img/fit5032-20221104.png)

### Which action in MVC request & response
![](img/fit5032-20221104-3.png)  
+ if no model in the project. The `controller` will received the user's command and return  the result to the `VIEW`

### Which functionality/files in each component of MVC?
![](img/fit5032-20221104-2.png)  
Model: 
+ database  
+ Defines the data validation rules  
+ contains code that defines its relationship with other models

Controller:
+ Controls the application flow or logic of the application
+ decides what response is to be generated and passes the response (output) to the  `view`
+  calls to `model` to access data

View:
+  View is the outputs or responses that are sent back to the user once a request is processed
+ the presentation layer of an application
+ Razor View in .net

### What is Model? Functionality? Responsibilities?
+ A class or set of classes that describes all the business logic and additionally<mark style="background: #3CB371;"> handles data access</mark> for an application.
+ Also contains code that<mark style="background: #3CB371;"> defines its relationship with other models</mark>.
+ Defines the <mark style="background: #3CB371;">data validation rules</mark> to be used when adding or updating data.

### What is Controller? Functionality? Responsibilities?
+ <mark style="background: #ff0000;">Controllers are the components that handle user interaction, work with the model, and ultimately select a view to render.</mark>
+ Controls the <mark style="background: #3CB371;">application flow or logic</mark> of the application
+ Controller logic decides what <mark style="background: #3CB371;">response</mark> is to be generated
+ Controller logic normally contains calls to models to <mark style="background: #0000CD;">access data</mark>, and also other functionalities like access control checks etc
+ Controller passes the response (output) to the view

### What is View? Functionality? Responsibilities?  
+ <mark style="background: #0000CD;">presenting content through the user interface.</mark> They use the Razor view engine to embed .NET code in HTML markup.
+ Consist of markup (like HTML) code with embedded .NET code. Can also be other forms of output like XML, PDF documents etc.
+ Views can be thought of as the <mark style="background: #0000CD;">presentation layer</mark> of an application and ideally should be as "dumb" as possible

### ★★ Advantages of ASP.NET MVC = Why use MVC? = MVC benefit
+ Enables the full control over the rendered HTML (前端可使用逻辑)
+ Provides clean separation of concerns(SoC). (职能可分开)
+  Enables Test Driven Development (TDD).(以method为单位  容易写test)
+  Easy integration with JavaScript frameworks.(容易集成js框架)
+ Following the design of stateless nature of the web. (网页不存数据从model拿数据，不记录用户状态及自身状态)
+ RESTful urls that enables Search Engine Optimisation.(get post in url)
+  No ViewState and PostBack events in comparison to ASP.NET Web Forms ()
### ★★★ Layers/Components in ASP.NET
+ Front End Technology (Razor)
+  .NET (This will be the server side programming technology)
+  IIS (This is the server itself)
+  MS SQL Server
### Separation of Concerns (SOC) 分成独立几个模块开发
+ ![](img/fit5032-20221104-4.png)
+ Is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that <mark style="background: #0000CD;">each section addresses a separate concern</mark>.
+ A concern can be as general as the details of the hardware the code is being optimized for, or as specific as the name of a class to instantiate.
+  The value of separation of concerns is<mark style="background: #3CB371;"> simplifying development and maintenance </mark>of computer programs.
+ When concerns are well-separated, <mark style="background: #0000CD;">individual sections can be reused, as well as developed and updated</mark> independently.
+  For example, user interface logic tends to change more frequently than business logic. If presentation code and business logic are combined in a single object, an object containing business logic must be modified every time the user interface is changed
### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) 每个模块如何划分 class， reuse
+ The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer-programming principle that states that <mark style="background: #D2691E;">every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality,</mark> and it should encapsulate that part.
