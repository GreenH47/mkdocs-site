# How to use the FIT study Note document
1. download the [markdown file repository](https://github.com/GreenH47/mynote) and  navigate to the `docs` folder
2. view all the markdown files via [Obsidian vault](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Working+with+multiple+vaults) that can show the linked section in the note document  ![](img/5032-20221103.png)  
3. You may find some extra material or program template  repository in the Course Brief introduction for the FIT Note markdown Document (some course don't have )

4. you can view [the web page](https://greenh47.github.io/mynote/) which transfer from MD file online but will lose the extra information or wrong    markdown display

[This repository](https://github.com/GreenH47/FIT5032_2022s2) contents weekly task and my assignment template for [FIT5032 - Internet Application Development](https://handbook.monash.edu/2022/units/FIT5032?year=2022) done for the year 2022. (Semester 2)  

Solutions are working out of the box. (Due to the nature of this unit)  
You can run the project by running the .mdf files which are intentionally in the repository so that it would be working. (some parts are hidden for safety but not influence the framework working)
