# what is html
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. 它告诉网络浏览器如何构建您访问的网页  
It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.可以使用这些元素来包围、包装或标记内容的不同部分，以使其以某种方式出现或运行  

```
<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
```
Tags in HTML are not case-sensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, a `<title>` tag could be written as `<title>`, `<TITLE>`, `<Title>`, `<TiTlE>`, etc., and it will work. However, it is best practice to write all tags in lowercase for consistency and readability.最好将所有标签都写成小写。
