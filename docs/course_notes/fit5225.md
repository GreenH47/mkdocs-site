[FIT5225 - Cloud computing and security](https://handbook.monash.edu/2023/units/FIT5225?year=2023) done for the year 2023. (Semester 1)  

# week 1 Introduction to Cloud Computing
## Lecture
This week we will cover the outline of the unit and then we go through the challenges of distributed systems followed by an introduction to cloud computing  

Introduction to Grid and Cluster Computing
We continue our discussion by introducing Grid and Cluster computing as one of the main pillars of cloud computing.   

Learning Objectives:  
describe fundamental principles and paradigms of cloud computing  

identify appropriate design choices when developing real-world cloud computing applications
## workshop
In this week tutorial classes, you will learn to work with Nectar as an example of a community cloud. You are supposed to run a virtual machine in the Nectar cloud and get familiar with the Nectar dashboard.

Upon successful completion of this tutorial, you will gain the required knowledge to access the Nectar portal, create/modify virtual machines, establish remote connections to your VMs, and perform administration tasks such as installing a web server and opening required ports using security groups.
