# week 1 Introduction to Cloud Computing
## Lecture
### Learning Objectives:  
describe fundamental principles and paradigms of cloud computing  

identify appropriate design choices when developing real-world cloud computing applications  

Summary  
• Computer Networks vs Distributed Systems  
• Distributed Systems Challenges: heterogeneity, openness, security, scalability, failure handling,  concurrency, transparency, Quality of Service.  
• Cloud computing is all about delivering computing services over the Internet.  
• Technologies significantly contributed to make cloud computing viable: Grid computing,  webservices, virtualization, autonomic computing  
• Cloud Deployment Models: private, community, public, hybrid  
• Cloud Service Models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS  
• Cloud and distributed computing skill is at the top of the most demanded job skills right now.
### Computer Networks vs Distributed Systems
+ A Computer Network: Is a collection of spatially separated, interconnected computers that  exchange messages based on specific protocols. Computers are addressed by IP addresses.  
+ A Distributed System: Multiple computers on the network working together as a system. The spatial  separation of computers and communication aspects are hidden from users
### Distributed System Challenges
1. Heterogeneity-  use hardware and software resources of  varying characteristics (how to solve: Using standard protocol;  agreed upon message formats; API; Middleware; )   
2. Openness: ability of extending the system in  different ways by adding hardware or software resources (key interfaces; uniform communication mechanism)  
3. Security: aspects of security (Confidentiality; Integrity;  Availability); Security Mechanisms(Encryption; Authentication; Authorization)  
4. Scalability: can handle the growth of the number of users.  
5. Concurrency 并发: access the same resource at the same time;
6. Failure Handling: Detecting, Masking, Tolerating, Recovery, Redundancy  
7. Transparency
8. Quality of Service (QoS) non-functional properties of systems that affect QoS are: Reliability , Security, Performance, Adaptability, Availability 
### Client-Server distributed architectures
![](../img/fit5225-20230312-33.png)
Clients invoke services in servers and results are returned. Servers in turn can become clients to other services
### Peer-to-Peer
![](../img/fit5225-20230312-35.png)
Each process in the systems plays a similar role interacting cooperatively as peers  (playing the roles of client and server simultaneously)
### Cloud Computing
An IT paradigm that enables access to shared pools of configurable system resources in form of services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort, often over the Internet.  d<mark style="background: #3CB371;">elivering computing services over the Internet.</mark>
Avoid expensive up-front investments of establishing their own infrastructure  
Cloud is the “invisible” backend to many application  
### Cloud Service Models

Grid computing: A type of parallel and distributed system to share compute and storage resources  distributed across different administrative domains
![](../img/fit5225-20230312-36.png)
### Web service
A Web service is a s<mark style="background: #ff0000;">oftware system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine  interaction over a network</mark> using HTTP and technologies such as XML, SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI. 
![](../img/fit5225-20230312-37.png)
### Hardware Virtualization
![](../img/fit5225-20230312-39.png)
hides the physical characteristics of a computing platform from the users, presenting  instead an abstract computing platform
### Autonomic Computing
Autonomic computing refers to the <mark style="background: #D2691E;">self-managing</mark> characteristics of distributed  computing resources, <mark style="background: #D2691E;">adapting to unpredictable changes</mark> while hiding intrinsic complexity to  operators and users

### parallel Computing Architectures
选择哪种系统取决于应用程序的特性和要求，以及系统的性能和可伸缩性需求。 
+ UMA系统适  合规模较小、数据共享需求较强的多处理器系统； 
+ SMP系统则更适合规模较大、数据共享需求 相对较弱的多处理器系统；
+ NUMA系统适合规模更大的多处理器系统，特别是需要高性能和可 伸缩性的应用程序； 
+ MPP系统适合处理大规模数据集和需要大量计算资源的应用程序
#### Massively Parallel Processors (MPP)
100+ nodes with a high-speed interconnection network/switch; Each node has 1+ processors, sharing of the main memory;  Separate copy of OS runs on each node  
These MPP databases([BigQuery Enterprise Data Warehouse  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=japac-AU-all-en-dr-BKWS-all-rmkt-trial-EXA-dr-1605216&utm_content=text-ad-none-none-DEV_c-CRE_648938225949-ADGP_Hybrid+%7C+BKWS+-+EXA+%7C+Txt+~+Data+Analytics_BigQuery_big+query_main-KWID_43700075272952174-kwd-63326440124&userloc_9071445-network_g&utm_term=KW_google%20bigquery&gclid=Cj0KCQiA6rCgBhDVARIsAK1kGPKA3oXdZG1wbH_J35kmtVKdu9pO4Jk_3uhmNYYiC39FvMBaQEQhJ0caAmGnEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)) are designed to handle large volumes of data and provide high  performance and scalability. They are commonly used in data warehousing and business intelligence application
#### Symmetric Multi-processors (SMP)
All global resources are shared among processors;  Nodes run the same OS (Enterprise servers; High-performance computing cluster; )   
SMP architecture is commonly used in medium- to large-scale multiprocessor systems, and  provides a simple and efficient way to achieve multiprocessing without the complexities of  NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) or MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) architectures.  SMP systems are typically used for applications that require shared access to a moderate  amount of memory and do not require high scalability or perform


#### Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)
Each processor has a global view of the available memory shared- address-space computer with local and global  memories (supercomputer; High-performance computing cluster)  
NUMA systems are typically used for large-scale parallel processing applications that require  high performance and scalability. They provide fast access to memory for each processor by  dividing the system memory into local and remote memory regions, and optimizing access to  these regions based on the location of the data being accessed. NUMA architecture can be  more complex and expensive to implement than UMA architecture, but it can provide better  performance and scalability for certain types of application

![](../img/fit5225-20230312-32.png)
### Parallel Programming
Shared Memory  • Threads  • Message Passing  • Data Parallel  • Hybrid  
Why?  
- To save time  
- Solve bigger and more complex problems  
- Leverage concurrency  
- It’s very expensive to build high capacity and powerful CPUs and connect them together 

How  
- Phase parallel  
- Divide and conquer  
- Pipeline  
- Process farm  
- Work pool  
Limitations and Challenges  
+ Finding efficient ways of parallelizing the source code
+ Designing and developing scalable algorithms is challenging
+ Message passing and job submission are not automated and need to be taken care of by the  user/programmer
+ Managing jobs in a parallel and distributed environment is prone to lots of errors, think about  communication, resource allocation, etc
### Cluster Computing
Cluster computing is a collection of tightly or loosely connected computers that work together so that they act as a single entity. The connected computers execute operations all together thus creating the idea of a single system. <mark style="background: #0000CD;">The clusters are generally connected through fast local area networks (LANs)</mark>
### Grid Computing
grid as a system that coordinates resources which are not subject to centralized control,  using standard, open, general-purpose protocols and interfaces to deliver nontrivial qualities of service
### Summary of Cluster, Grid, and Cloud Computing
![](../img/fit5225-20230312-47.png)
### Open Multi-Processing (OpenMPI)
A master thread forks a number of sub-threads and divides tasks between them    
Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) is an API that includes directives for multi-threaded, shared memory parallel programming. Thread-based rather than using message passing
### Message Passing Interface (MPI)
![](../img/fit5225-20230313.png)
MPI is a standardized and portable message-passing system to function on a wide variety of  parallel computers.  Widely adopted for inter-process communication in parallel systems. • Supports both p2p and collective modes of communication

# Week 3 Virtualization
## Lecture
+ Hardware Virtualization  
+ Virtualization Features: Isolation, Encapsulation, Portability, and Interposition’  
+ Hypervisor, Virtual Machine, Guest Operating System, Host  
+ Processor, Memory and I/O Devices virtualization  
+ Live and cold VM migration  
+ Case studies: Xen and VMWare  

describe fundamental principles and paradigms of cloud computing;  
demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of virtualisation and container technologies;  

### Virtualization
Virtualization is a broad concept that refers to the creation of a virtual version of something, whether  hardware, a software environment, storage, or a network.  

#### Motivations for virtualization
+ Optimal allocation of the virtual machines to physical server  
+ Virtualization is very relevant to the provision of cloud computing (multi-tenancy)  
+ Create and destroy virtual machines readily and with little overhead  
+ Several different operating system environments on a single desktop computer  
#### Virtualization Features
+ Isolation隔离 (Fault isolation, performance, software isolation)  
+ Encapsulation封装 (Cleanly capture all VM state, enables VM snapshots, clone VMs easily, make copies)  
+ Portability可移植性 (Independent of physical hardware, enables live and cold migration of VMs)  
+ Interposition插入(Transformations on instructions, memory, I/O Enables transparent resource over commitment, encryption, compression, replication)
#### Virtualization Types
![](../img/fit5225-20230313-4.png)
+ Full virtualization : identical interface to the underlying physical architecture  unmodified guest operating system(VMware, Virtualbox)  
+ Paravirtualization : guest operating systems to communicate with the hypervisor.  guest os to be modified in order to interact with paravirtualization interface  communicates with the hypervisor using driver  higher performance (XEN)

### Hardware Virtualization  
The term virtualization is often synonymous with hardware virtualization/system virtualization.  “a technique for hiding the physical characteristics of computing resources which allows having  multiple virtual machines (VMs) over the underlying physical machine architecture, with each virtual  machine running a separate operating system instance.
### Hypervisor 管理程序
![](../img/fit5225-20230313-2.png)
+ Hardware virtualization is implemented by a thin layer of software on  top of the underlying physical machine architecture referred to as  Hypervisor (Virtual Machine Monitor).  
+ Virtual Machine: A representation of a real machine using  hardware/software that can host a guest operating system  
+ Guest Operating System: An operating system that runs in a virtual  machine  
+ Host: the original environment where the guest OS is supposed to  be managed

### Computing Systems
![](../img/fit5225-20230313-3.png)
1. Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)  
2. Application Binary Interface (ABI)  
3. Application programming interface (API)  
For any operation to be performed in the  application level API, ABI and ISA are  responsible for making it happen

### Virtualizing Memory

## Tutorial
upon successful completion of this tutorial, you will gain the required knowledge to access Oracle Cloud Infrastructure  (OCI), create/modify virtual machines, running a micro web framework, and working with Postman  
1. `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip curl && pip3 install flask` install the `python3-pip` and `curl` packages, and then install the `flask` package using `pip3`  
2. `touch flask_script.py` create py file  
3. `nano flask_script.py` open the file in the nano text editor 
4. `sudo apt update` check for any updates available for the installed packages and update  
5. `sudo apt install firewalld` install firewall service that provides a dynamically managed firewall with support for network/firewall zones
6. `sudo systemctl enable firewalld` `firewalld` service will start automatically every time the system boots up  
7. `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=5000/tc` add a permanent rule to the firewall on Ubuntu to allow incoming traffic on port 5000 for TCP protocol.  
8. `sudo firewall-cmd --reload` reload the `firewalld` firewall configuration. This means that any changes made to the firewall rules, such as adding or removing ports, will take effect immediately without having to restart the firewall service.  
9. `python3 flask_script.py &`  command that runs the `flask_script.py` Python script in the background as a separate process  
10. `curl -iX GET <IP-ADDR>:5000/` use the `curl` tool to make an HTTP GET request to the web server running on the specified IP address and port 5000. The server will then respond with an HTTP response that includes the requested data, and the `-i` option will cause `curl` to display the HTTP header along with the response body.
