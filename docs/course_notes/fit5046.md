# How to use the FIT study Note document
1. download the [markdown file repository](https://github.com/GreenH47/mynote) and  navigate to the `docs` folder
2. view all the markdown files via [Obsidian vault](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Working+with+multiple+vaults) that can show the linked section in the note document  ![](../img/5032-20221103.png)  
3. You may find some extra material or program template  repository in the Course Brief introduction for the FIT Note markdown Document (some course don't have )

4. you can view [the web page](https://greenh47.github.io/mynote/) which transfer from MD file online but will lose the extra information or wrong    markdown display

This unit focuses on the most current and key topics in mobile and distributed computing. We will mainly focus on learning key concepts of mobile computing using Android, and then look at ubiquitous and context-aware computing, IoT, wireless sensors, and location-aware computing. While we will discuss these topics in the lectures, you will learn practically in the labs how to create and develop a mobile, distributed Android app. Each semester we develop a real world and useful mobile app for Android platforms.
