评估：事件/事件/学习中最令人满意和/或最令人不安的是什么？ ● 分析：您认为为什么会发生这种情况？你还能做什么？ ● 行动计划：对未来有何影响？如果再发生一次，你会怎么做？报告您尝试过的操作  

Yourself – to reflect on your personal growth and learning over any given week and the life of the project. To develop a range of strategies and techniques to draw upon 你自己反思你在任意一周和项目生命周期中的个人成长和学习。制定一系列可供借鉴的策略和技术  
Identifying significant events / incidents / learning including
● A brief description of what happened including your own and others
actions
● How you felt at the time
● What was most satisfactory and/or troubling about the event / incident / learning?
● What are the implications for future practice – What could you have done differently?
● What was learned?
● What action (if any) will you take as a result of this experience?
识别重大事件/事件/学习，包括 ● 简要描述所发生的事情，包括您自己和他人的行为 ● 您当时的感受 ● 对事件/事件/学习最满意和/或最困扰的是什么？ ● 对未来实践有何影响——您可以采取哪些不同的做法？ ● 学到了什么？ ● 由于这次经历，您将采取什么行动（如果有）？  

Instead, reflect on. How did you meet?
相反，反思一下。你们是怎么认识的？
What did you how did you feel when you met your team? What did you learn from the marshmallow challenge?
当你遇到你的团队时，你有什么感觉？你从棉花糖挑战中学到了什么？
What would you change if you did that marshmallow challenge again?
如果你再次做棉花糖挑战，你会改变什么？
What would you do differently? What did you learn about your team members?
你会做什么不同的事情？你从你的团队成员身上学到了什么？
Maybe you have noticed that you were sitting back and being quiet.
也许你已经注意到你坐下来保持安静。
Maybe the action next time is that I shouldn't be voice my opinion in a very polite and professional way.
也许下一次的行动是我不应该以非常礼貌和专业的方式表达我的意见。
Well, maybe I was taking the lead and I wasn't giving my team members a chance or so excited with this challenge.
好吧，也许我带头了，我没有给我的团队成员机会，也没有对这个挑战感到兴奋。
Or I've done this before so I know what to do.
或者我以前做过这个，所以我知道该怎么做。
So what action would you do differently and how would you take those learnings for the next 11 weeks of of this unit?
那么，你会采取什么不同的行动，你将如何在本单元接下来的11周里学习这些东西？
So my recommendation to you is that perhaps putting these sentences as headings, I'm going to slip them one scenario, maybe even two scenarios.
所以我对你的建议是，也许把这些句子作为标题，我会把它们塞进一个场景，甚至两个场景。
So for an example we can talk about the event will be a marshmallow challenge,
因此，例如我们可以谈论该事件将是棉花糖挑战，
a brief description of of of your what you did and others actions and how you
简要描述您的所作所为和其他行为以及您如何
felt at the time of meeting your team during the challenge for the first time.
在挑战期间第一次见到你的团队时的感觉。
What was the most satisfactory or troubling about the marshmallow challenge or just meeting your team?
棉花糖挑战或只是与您的团队会面最令人满意或最麻烦的是什么？
What could you done differently from the marshmallow challenge as yourself, and what did you learn?
作为你自己，你能做些什么与棉花糖挑战不同的事情，你学到了什么？、
