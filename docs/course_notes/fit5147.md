## tutorial
-   be able to read, check, clean and transform data with R
-   be able to do create advanced plots and visualisations using ggplot2

# Assignment 1 Project Proposal
## requirement
```ad-note
title: Requirment
collapse:

1. Identify the project topic, related questions that you want to address, and data source(s) that you will be using to answer those questions.
2. Submit your Project Proposal in the Assessment section of Moodle in Week 3 Project Proposal (2%) Monday, 13 March 2023, 9:30 AM  

Write a one page document consists of the following sections:
 > 1. Your full name, student ID, tutors’ names, and tutorial number.
 > 2. Project title.
 > 3. Brief introduction of your topic and motivation (max 1-2 paragraphs).
 > 4. Up to 3 questions you wish to answer. The number of questions depends on the scope of the question itself. You can have one general question or three more detailed ones.
 > 5. Data source(s) you plan to use to answer these questions, including a brief description of the data in each data source (e.g., number of rows; number of columns; type of data: tabular, spatial, network, textual or other; URL).
 > 6. The bibliographical details of any references you have cited in the previous sections.  
 
The topic and questions should allow for interesting and detailed analysis in the Data Exploration Project (DEP) and the subsequent Data Visualisation Project (DVP, due at the end of semester), which involves presenting the findings from your DEP in a narrative format. It is strongly recommended that you do not include questions that are
● too easy to answer (e.g., what is the correlation between x and y, what is the average value of z variable, what are the top/bottom N values), or
● too difficult to do, or
● not relevant to the unit (e.g., training a machine learning model), or
● are not possible to find out from the data sources provided
 > Proposals with such questions will all be rejected (and not receive the Suitability and Clarity grade, according to the marking rubric). If in doubt, you should talk to your tutor during their consultation before the due date.
 >  Good questions are general enough that they are not linked to specific parts of the data, allowing for more open-ended and exploratory analysis. For instance, asking “Where is the safest part of the network?” lets you explore various interpretations of how to link “where” and “safest” to the data about a network, whereas “Which LGA-code has the lowest value of number-of-deaths?” is very specific to the data and limits the exploration and visualisations possible.
 > The data must be accessible to the teaching staff, so the use of open data is encouraged (see the list of suggested data sources at the end of this document). Use of closed or proprietary data is allowed as long as explicit permission has been granted by the original source(s) for its use in the assignment.
 >  The data should include the last couple of years. Avoid common topics like COVID-19, unless you can think of some novel questions relating to it, perhaps by also using data on another related topic and from a different source. In such a case, you must discuss your intentions with your tutor before the due date.
 >  Please ensure you read the rest of this entire document before deciding on your project, as the proposal is for the entire Data Exploration Project. See the end of this document for an example proposal and potential data sources that you may look at to get yourself started

## how to write the proposal
```ad-note
title: Establish the research area based on:
 1. your interest area   (Player transfer; Player Hot area; AirBNB )  
1. which area is popular (covid; House price; Digital mining)   
1. where can you find the available data ([Kaggle: Your Machine Learning and Data Science Community](https://www.kaggle.com/); [FiveThirtyEight | FiveThirtyEight uses statistical analysis — hard numbers — to tell compelling stories about politics, sports, science, economics and culture.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/))  
2. Which research direction (Which city is the most popular vacation destination? Why this position has more chance to goal? From different month and area to analysis )  
```


```ad-note
title: How to write:
1.  Why come up this idea
2. how to select the data  
3.  relation between different column (logic integration)
```

# Programming Exercise 1: Tableau Public
```ad-note
title: Requirment
collapse:

1. Use data visualisation to check for and find the three aforementioned irregularities in the dataset. Each types of irregularity may occur multiple times in the data.  
2. Amend the data to correct these errors using any tool of your choice (e.g., Excel,  Python, R, Tableau)  
3. Using visual analysis, answer the following questions (Q1: Compare and contrast when different types of frogs were observed.  Consider this on both an hourly and a monthly timescale. What does this  suggest about the behaviour of the researchers or the frogs?  Q2: Compare and contrast the “Type of Observation” used to gather the  data. How does this variable support, challenge or change your conclusions)
4. Write a report that describes this data exploration process (see below for details)  
  
Written Report  
Once you have finished your data exploration, write a report that contains the following  information:  
1. Data checking and cleaning (i.e., Steps 1 to 3)  
An image to show what your data looks like after loading it in Tableau  
A brief explanation (maximum of one paragraph per error) and an  accompanying image of each of the errors or irregularities that you have  found, showing how you found them using Tableau, and explaining &  justifying how you resolved them. The image must show a relevant  visualisation, not just the data or a table.  A简要说明（每个错误最多一段）和一张您发现的每个错误或违规行为的图片，显示您如何使用 Tableau 发现它们，并解释和证明您是如何解决它们的。图片必须显示相关的可视化效果，而不仅仅是数据或表格
2. Data exploration (i.e., Step 4)  
Your answers to Q1 and Q2 with accompanying images of the data  visualisations that you used to support your analysis, and a brief explanation  of why you have used those type of visualisations 您对 Q1 和 Q2 的回答，以及您用于支持分析的数据可视化的附带图像，以及您使用这些类型的可视化的原因的简要说明
