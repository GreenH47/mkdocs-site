# Assignment 1 Project Proposal
## requirement
```ad-note
title: Requirment
collapse:

1. Identify the project topic, related questions that you want to address, and data source(s) that you will be using to answer those questions.
2. Submit your Project Proposal in the Assessment section of Moodle in Week 3 Project Proposal (2%) Monday, 13 March 2023, 9:30 AM  

Write a one page document consists of the following sections:
 > 1. Your full name, student ID, tutors’ names, and tutorial number.
 > 2. Project title.
 > 3. Brief introduction of your topic and motivation (max 1-2 paragraphs).
 > 4. Up to 3 questions you wish to answer. The number of questions depends on the scope of the question itself. You can have one general question or three more detailed ones.
 > 5. Data source(s) you plan to use to answer these questions, including a brief description of the data in each data source (e.g., number of rows; number of columns; type of data: tabular, spatial, network, textual or other; URL).
 > 6. The bibliographical details of any references you have cited in the previous sections.  
 
The topic and questions should allow for interesting and detailed analysis in the Data Exploration Project (DEP) and the subsequent Data Visualisation Project (DVP, due at the end of semester), which involves presenting the findings from your DEP in a narrative format. It is strongly recommended that you do not include questions that are
● too easy to answer (e.g., what is the correlation between x and y, what is the average value of z variable, what are the top/bottom N values), or
● too difficult to do, or
● not relevant to the unit (e.g., training a machine learning model), or
● are not possible to find out from the data sources provided
 > Proposals with such questions will all be rejected (and not receive the Suitability and Clarity grade, according to the marking rubric). If in doubt, you should talk to your tutor during their consultation before the due date.
 >  Good questions are general enough that they are not linked to specific parts of the data, allowing for more open-ended and exploratory analysis. For instance, asking “Where is the safest part of the network?” lets you explore various interpretations of how to link “where” and “safest” to the data about a network, whereas “Which LGA-code has the lowest value of number-of-deaths?” is very specific to the data and limits the exploration and visualisations possible.
 > The data must be accessible to the teaching staff, so the use of open data is encouraged (see the list of suggested data sources at the end of this document). Use of closed or proprietary data is allowed as long as explicit permission has been granted by the original source(s) for its use in the assignment.
 >  The data should include the last couple of years. Avoid common topics like COVID-19, unless you can think of some novel questions relating to it, perhaps by also using data on another related topic and from a different source. In such a case, you must discuss your intentions with your tutor before the due date.
 >  Please ensure you read the rest of this entire document before deciding on your project, as the proposal is for the entire Data Exploration Project. See the end of this document for an example proposal and potential data sources that you may look at to get yourself started

## quiz
```
Which of the following statements is incorrect? 
a. Common analytic techniques are required to determine the values of visual variables. 
b. A visual variable can be used to help visually differentiate between different values in the data. 
c. The size and shape of each point in a scatter plot may be visual variables. 
d. Visual variables are encoded to parts of the data.

Which of the following statements is incorrect? a. Common analytic techniques are required to determine the values of visual variables. b.

Visual variables are encoded to parts of the data.
```

```
What does visual encoding mean in visualisation design? 
a. How data is aggregated and filtered 
b. How the user interacts with the visualisation 
c. How different views are arranged 
d. How data is mapped to visual and spatial variables e. How the visualisation is programmed

D. Visual encoding in visualization design refers to the process of mapping data to visual and spatial variables, such as position, size, shape, color, and texture, among others. This involves assigning different visual variables to different data attributes in order to represent the data in a meaningful and effective way. By using visual encoding, designers can create visualizations that allow users to see patterns, trends, and relationships in the data more easily, and to gain insights that might be difficult to discern from raw data. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.
```

```
Given the total sales for different product categories at multiple stores, which of the following would be the best visualisation idiom to compare the relative proportion of sales for different product categories across all stores? 
a. Compound bar chart 
b. Spider diagram 
c. Normalised stacked bar chart 
d. Parallel coordinates for each store with axes for each product category 
e. Histogram

A normalized stacked bar chart allows you to display the contribution of each product category to total sales in a stacked bar chart format, with each category represented by a different color. Normalizing the data means that each bar represents a percentage of the total sales for that store, making it easier to compare the relative contributions of each category across stores. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.
```

```
Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of hierarchical clustering? 
a. It can be visualised using a parallel coordinates plot 
b. It can be visualised using a dendrogram 
c. Cophenetic correlation coefficient can be used to measure how well the clustering explains the data 
d. An item that belong to a child group also belongs to the parent group 
e. It can be done using UPGMA (unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages) method

parallel coordinates plot is a visualization technique used to display multivariate data by plotting each observation as a sequence of points along a set of parallel axes.
```

```
Which of the following visualisations is a radial version of parallel coordinates? 
a. Small multiples 
b. Pie chart 
c. Spider diagram or radar chart 
d. Doughnut chart e. Scatter plot matrix (SPLOM)

This chart displays multivariate data by plotting each observation as a point on a set of radial axes, with one axis for each variable. Each variable has a value that determines the position along its corresponding axis, and the resulting shape of the plot reveals patterns and relationships in the data. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.
```

```
Which of the following is an example of categorical data? 
a. Name 
b. Yearly salary 
c. Education level 
d. Age 
e. Height
Categorical data consists of categories or labels that are not numerical in nature, and it can be further divided into nominal and ordinal categories. In this case, education level is an example of ordinal categorical data because it has a natural ordering (e.g., high school, bachelor's degree, master's degree, etc.). The other options are all examples of numerical data or continuous data. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.
```

What is the kind of data to be visualised?
Why is the data being visualised— what task does the user wish to perform?
How is the data visually represented and what interaction is provided?

What:
Tabular data: Data organised in tables, a row for each data Item and a column for each of its attributes.
Spatial data: Data which is naturally organised and understood in terms of its spatial location or extent.
Network data: Nodes in the network are data items and links between the nodes are relations between. For instance a social network.
Textual data: Textual documents and collections of textual documents


Why (according to Munzner) has 3 main reasons:
Discover: derive insight from the data. This includes both data checking and exploration.
Present: present insight or knowledge to some intended audience;
Enjoy: Visualisations that entice and entertain.

Discover - Analytical tasks include:
Search for elements that satisfy certain properties, if they exist. This might be locating a known data point, filtering the data, or finding outliers.
Identify the properties of a single data item
Compare or rank elements
Visually identify patterns in some subset of elements.
Calculate derived properties not originally in the data.

Present - Presentation tasks include
Visualise by mapping elements and their attributes to visual variables to create a view
Manipulate (or configure) a view by navigating and selecting subsets of elements

Providence tasks that further support analysis include
Annotate visual elements with text or graphical elements
Record visualisation elements so that they can be preserved and accessed outside the analytics tool.
Revisit an earlier visualisation or relocate an element or pattern that was previously found by the analyst
