## Learning Objectives:
At the end of this week, you should:

-   be able to read data into **R** and **Tableau Public** and use visualisations to explore the data
-   understand the role visualisation plays in data science: data checking and cleaning, exploration and discovery, and the presentation and communication of results
-   know what visual analytics is and have an understanding of the complementary role visualisation and data analytics play in data science

# Week 2 Visualisation Of Tabular Data
## Learning objectives
-   seen the many standard visualisations <mark style="background: #ff0000;">(line graphs, bar charts, frequency distributions, time series data etc 折线图、条形图、频率分布、时间序列数据等)</mark> for showing tabular data and know when to use them;
-   seen standard visualisations for <mark style="background: #3CB371;">multivariate tabular data (small multiples, MDS, SPLOMs etc) and know when to use them; 多元表格数据（小倍数、MDS、SPLOM 等）的标准可视化</mark>
-   the ability to use these visualisation to <mark style="background: #D2691E;">understand data distributions, to test assumptions such as normality and to guide transformation of data; 理解数据分布、测试正态性等假设并指导数据转换</mark>
-   knowledge of curve and surface fitting to data; 曲线和曲面拟合数据
-   knowledge of data clustering techniques; 数据聚类技术
-   have first-hand experience with R<mark style="background: #0000CD;"> and the graphics package ggplot2</mark> to
    -   read, check, clean and transform data;读取、检查、清理和转换数据；
    -   construct standard visualisations for tabular data, curve fitting, data clustering and to understand data distributions; 为表格数据、曲线拟合、数据聚类构建标准可视化并理解数据分布
    -   create interactive visualisations using the package Shiny.使用包 Shiny 创建交互式可视化。

-   be able to read, check, clean and transform data with R
-   be able to do create advanced plots and visualisations using ggplot2

# Assignment 1 Project Proposal
## requirment
> [!INFO]- Requirment   
 > 1. Identify the project topic, related questions that you want to address, and data source(s) that you will be using to answer those questions.
 > 2. Submit your Project Proposal in the Assessment section of Moodle in Week 3 Project Proposal (2%) Monday, 13 March 2023, 9:30 AM  
 > Write a one page document consists of the following sections:
 > 1. Your full name, student ID, tutors’ names, and tutorial number.
 > 2. Project title.
 > 3. Brief introduction of your topic and motivation (max 1-2 paragraphs).
 > 4. Up to 3 questions you wish to answer. The number of questions depends on the scope of the question itself. You can have one general question or three more detailed ones.
 > 5. Data source(s) you plan to use to answer these questions, including a brief description of the data in each data source (e.g., number of rows; number of columns; type of data: tabular, spatial, network, textual or other; URL).
 > 6. The bibliographical details of any references you have cited in the previous sections.  
 >  The topic and questions should allow for interesting and detailed analysis in the Data Exploration Project (DEP) and the subsequent Data Visualisation Project (DVP, due at the end of semester), which involves presenting the findings from your DEP in a narrative format. It is strongly recommended that you do not include questions that are
● too easy to answer (e.g., what is the correlation between x and y, what is the average value of z variable, what are the top/bottom N values), or
● too difficult to do, or
● not relevant to the unit (e.g., training a machine learning model), or
● are not possible to find out from the data sources provided
 > Proposals with such questions will all be rejected (and not receive the Suitability and Clarity grade, according to the marking rubric). If in doubt, you should talk to your tutor during their consultation before the due date.
 >  Good questions are general enough that they are not linked to specific parts of the data, allowing for more open-ended and exploratory analysis. For instance, asking “Where is the safest part of the network?” lets you explore various interpretations of how to link “where” and “safest” to the data about a network, whereas “Which LGA-code has the lowest value of number-of-deaths?” is very specific to the data and limits the exploration and visualisations possible.
 > The data must be accessible to the teaching staff, so the use of open data is encouraged (see the list of suggested data sources at the end of this document). Use of closed or proprietary data is allowed as long as explicit permission has been granted by the original source(s) for its use in the assignment.
 >  The data should include the last couple of years. Avoid common topics like COVID-19, unless you can think of some novel questions relating to it, perhaps by also using data on another related topic and from a different source. In such a case, you must discuss your intentions with your tutor before the due date.
 >  Please ensure you read the rest of this entire document before deciding on your project, as the proposal is for the entire Data Exploration Project. See the end of this document for an example proposal and potential data sources that you may look at to get yourself started

## how to write the proposal
> [!example] Establish the research area based on: 
> 1. your interest area   (Player transfer; Player Hot area; AirBNB )  
 > 1. which area is popular (covid; House price; Digital mining)   
 > 1. where can you find the available data ([Kaggle: Your Machine Learning and Data Science Community](https://www.kaggle.com/); [FiveThirtyEight | FiveThirtyEight uses statistical analysis — hard numbers — to tell compelling stories about politics, sports, science, economics and culture.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/))  
> 2. Which research direction (Which city is the most popular vacation destination? Why this position has more chance to goal? From different month and area to analysis )  


> [!example] How to write: 
 > 1.  Why come up this idea
 > 2. how to select the data  
 > 3.  relation between different column (logic integration)
