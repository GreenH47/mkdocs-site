The controller will received the user's command and return the result to the VIEW Which functionality/files in each component of MVC? # Model: + database + Defines the data validation rules + contains code that defines its relationship with other models Controller: + Controls the application flow or logic of the application + decides what response is to be generated and passes the response (output) to the view + calls to model to access data View: + View is the outputs or responses that are sent back to the user once a request is processed + the presentation layer of an application + Razor View in .net What is Model? Functionality? Responsibilities? # A class or set of classes that describes all the business logic and additionally handles data access for an application. Also contains code that defines its relationship with other models . Defines the data validation rules to be used when adding or updating data. What is Controller? Functionality? Responsibilities? # Controllers are the components that handle user interaction, work with the model, and ultimately select a view to render. Controls the application flow or logic of the application Controller logic decides what response is to be generated Controller logic normally contains calls to models to access data , and also other functionalities like access control checks etc Controller passes the response (output) to the view What is View? Functionality? Responsibilities? # presenting content through the user interface. They use the Razor view engine to embed .NET code in HTML markup. Consist of markup (like HTML) code with embedded .NET code. Can also be other forms of output like XML, PDF documents etc. Views can be thought of as the presentation layer of an application and ideally should be as \"dumb\" as possible \u2605\u2605 Advantages of ASP.NET MVC = Why use MVC? = MVC benefit # Enables the full control over the rendered HTML (\u524d\u7aef\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u903b\u8f91) Provides clean separation of concerns(SoC).

A concern can be as general as the details of the hardware the code is being optimized for, or as specific as the name of a class to instantiate. The value of separation of concerns is simplifying development and maintenance of computer programs. When concerns are well-separated, individual sections can be reused, as well as developed and updated independently. For example, user interface logic tends to change more frequently than business logic. If presentation code and business logic are combined in a single object, an object containing business logic must be modified every time the user interface is changed Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) \u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5982\u4f55\u5212\u5206 class\uff0c reuse # The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer-programming principle that states that every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part.

You had just been hired as a software engineer by the founders. On your first day in the new job you asked the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) about SmartComputing\u2019s software engineering process. She replied: We follow the Unified Process to make sure we develop the right product in the right way. The process consists of five distinct workflows. We complete all the tasks and confirm all the documentations in each workflow before we move on to the next workflow. (waterfall plan driven\u53ea\u6709\u7eb5\u5411\u6ca1\u6709 \u6a2a\u5411) The first workflow is the Requirements Workflow, where we brainstorm ideas about features that our customers will love to have. The next workflow is the Analysis Workflow. This involves analysing the problem domain more deeply and describing the requirements in the kind of exacting detail that developers need. Typically, in this workflow we will produce conceptual class diagrams,detailed use case scenarios, interaction diagrams and statecharts. Once the Analysis Workflow is completed, we begin the Design Workflow, where we refine the conceptual class diagram into something more concrete, producing a detailed class diagram. The next workflow of the process is the Implementation Workflow. In this workflow, we write the code to implement the detailed class diagram produced in the previous workflow. Finally, we will have the Test Workflow, where we test our program to ensure that the system works correctly. Based on what you have learned in FIT5136, analyse and critique the company\u2019s software engineering process described above by the CTO 1a workflow # ==\u5fc5\u8003Workflows== The Unified Process has two dimensions: The vertical process that are more technical oriented (Requirement, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing , The horizontal processes that are more business oriented (Inception, Elaboration, Construction and Transition). The vertical process is similar to the company\u2019s description of the \u201cUnified process\u201d (incrementation) The company does no t focus on horizontal process at all (Iterations among workflows) which are more business oriented .The main thing that makes unified process is the combination of these two dimensions-iteration and incrementation . From the CTO description, the company process is therefore too similar to traditional waterfall model \u2013step by step \u2013 one workflow after another is like one phase after another. From the description, the company focuses on testing at the end of the process. Testing should not just be done at the end for the Unified Process! Testing should also be done in every workflow \u2013 the entire process ! Test Workflow should cover testings during every workflow \u2013 inspection, human reviews and checking for traceability of artefacts There should also be more testing of program at the end like integration testing, system testing and acceptance testing in the final testing question 2 use case diagram + use case scenario # scenario # You then asked the CTO about the latest project the company is undertaking. She mentioned that the project is to develop an on-line learning platform called Poodle 2 system for the university. The first task you, as the software engineer, are assigned for ==Poodle 2== is the analysis of the functionality of adding students to the system: ==An administrator is able to add a student enrolled in a unit==. An ==administrator can also list the students added in the last 24 hours== and also ==delete a student if it was added by mistake== (a) Draw a UML use case diagram for this functionality. (b) On the next page is a detailed description of the normal scenario for the \u201cAdd Student\u201d use case, with no exception conditions. ==Write three exception conditions, including reasonable actions to be taken==. 2a UML use case diagram # ==\u91cd\u70b9USE CASE DIAGRAMS== admin is initiator so in the left 2b use case scenario # Use case scenario Question 2 (b) Solutions (reasonable exceptions include (but not limited to): + 2.1 If the administrator enters the wrong id, then System displays message to try again + 2.1 If the administrator enters the wrong password, then System displays message to try again. + 3.1 If the student is not found, go back to the main page. + 3.1 If the id entered is not a student, go back to the main page. + 4.1 If the unit is not found, go back to the main page. + 5.1 If the student cannot be added because he is already enrolled in the unit, go back to the main page. + 6.1 Administrator hits cancel, go back to the main page question 3 noun extractions + initial class diagram # scenario # The CTO provides more description about the Poodle 2 project below: The ==university== that we graduated from has a very bad ==on-line learning platform called Poodle==. We were asked to improve and extend the current system. I think we were successful in getting the project because three of us were former students and we had used their system before. Based on my experience, I can confirm that the system is really bad and definitely needs improvements. We ==call this project Poodle 2.== Every user of Poodle 2 is identified by ==an id and a name==. To use the system, every user will need a ==password== to log in. In Poodle 2, ==administrators== can ==create units==. Each ==unit is identified by a unit code and a unit name==. ==Teaching staff== can ==create contents in units== they teach and each teaching staff can teach up to ==four unit==s. ==Students have access to the contents as long as they are enrolled in the unit==. Every student can enrol in up to ==four units==. An ==administrator can add a student to the unit== if the student is officially enrolled in the unit. An ==administrator can also delete a student from the unit if the student is no longer enrolled.== Students are allowed to ==comment on units and contents in Poodle 2==. Comments on a unit and comments on its contents can ==only be created and viewed by students currently enrolled in the unit and staff teaching the unit==. ==Users given authorisation can post replies to a comment.== A ==lecturer of a unit or an administrator can remove a comment== if the comment is deemed inappropriate, irrelevant or not useful in general Based on the CTO\u2019s description of the Poodle 2 project and the use case scenario in Question 2, you are tasked to produce an initial class diagram for the project 3a noun extractions # Classification of identified nouns \u5df2\u8bc6\u522b\u540d\u8bcd\u7684\u5206\u7c7b (a) Perform noun extractions and build a dictionary of abstractions for the system. Use it to decide on your candidate classes by assessing each abstraction and considering whether it: lies outside the problem boundary and may therefore be ignored, is a candidate entity class, or is likely to be a simple attribute of a class Outside the problem boundary and may therefore be ignored: + platform, experience, Poodle 2 (okay to make this an entity class), project, system, Poodle, Improvement Candidate entity classes: + University, Unit, Administrator, User, Teaching Staff, Student, Comment, Lecturer, Content Attributes: + id, name, password, unit code, unit name, replies (reply), authorisation. 3b initial UML class diagram # ==\u91cd\u70b9Initial Class Diagram== (b) Develop an initial UML class diagram for the system, with the relevant classes and attributes resulting from your dictionary of abstractions. Concentrate on modelling the problem domain rather than any boundary or control classes. Make sure you: include appropriate attributes for the classes describe the relationship between classes using generalization, association, aggregation and composition (as appropriate) indicate the multiplicity (cardinality) of the relationships properly. DO NOT include responsibilities or operations. You do not have all the information at this point to do so question 4 # Based on the initial class diagram you have produced for Question 3 and the use case scenario in Question 2, produce a sequence diagram to show the messages exchanged between objects needed to carry out the Add Student use case scenario 4a sequence diagram # ==\u91cd\u70b9Sequence_diagram== question 5 statechart diagram # scenario # After some discussions inside the company, it was decided that the commenting feature should be enhanced to make it more useful. An informal description of the new feature was documented below. \u201cA ==user can create comments about any content== in Poodle 2. The comment is ==publicly visible by default==. However, the ==author of the comment can subsequently make the comment visible only to a group of users==. A ==comment can be reported by a user== if she deems it to be inappropriate, irrelevant or not useful. Once reported, a ==comment can be deleted by a member of the teaching staff or a system administrator.== An accidentally ==deleted comment can be subsequently restored by a member of the teaching staff or an administrator==.

One week before the project deadline, the ==Chief Technical Officer (CTO)== called ==your team leader== into her office and showed him a piece of functionality implemented in the latest version of a competitor\u2019s software, Noodle. The CTO said, \u201cThis is a feature we must have! Please ask the team to implement it by the end of the week so that we can demo the feature to the university.\u201d You were asked by your team leader to start designing it. After thinking for a couple of hours, you came to the conclusion that Poodle 2 was so different from Noodle that this feature simply didn\u2019t make sense for Poodle 2. Moreover, it was not only difficult to implement, it would also make the system less reliable. ==You went back to the team leader to discuss these issues with him. The team leader then had a meeting with the CTO and explained your concerns to her (good).== After hearing the team leader\u2019s explanation, the CTO was still adamant about including the feature in Poodle 2. To convince the team leader that it was easy to implement, she showed him the ==source code of Noodle, which is free and open-source==, and asked him to ==\u201cjust copy their code then you\u2019re done!\u201d(bad illegal)== The team ==leader went ahead, followed her suggestions and completed the implementation on time for the demo== 6a ethical # ==\u91cd\u70b9software Engineering Code of Ethic== What are the ethical and professional issues that arise with the behaviour of the CTO and the team leader in this situation? How would you evaluate their behaviours? In your answer, you must refer to the applicable parts of the Software Engineering code of ethics Team leader (and I) did the right thing initially because we try to raise the initial concerns with the CTO. We tried to adhere to the following clauses: + 2.06 Identify, document, collect evidence and report to the employer promptly if, in their opinion, a project is likely to be problematic.(\u62a5\u544a\u95ee\u9898) + 3.10 Ensure adequate testing, debugging and review of software and related documents on which they work \uff08\u4e13\u4e1a\u5224\u65ad\uff09 However, after the initial meeting CTO as well as the team leader did not take care of the issue with free and open source software: + \u00a7 \u201cOpen Source\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you can reuse portions of the code for your work. + \u00a7 They need to find out what OS (Open Source) license the author has before they can reuse and copy. They are therefore in breach of the following clauses: + 2.02 Not knowingly use software that is obtained or retained either illegally or unethically. + 3.03 Identify, define and address ethical, economic, cultural, legal and environmental issues related to work projects. + 3.05 Ensure an appropriate method is used for any project on which they work or propose to work + 3.13 Be careful to use only accurate data derived by ethical and lawful means, and use it only in ways properly authorised. (copy code) By telling the team leader to go ahead and copy, CTO has also breached the following management clauses: + 5.01 Ensure good management for any project on which they work, including effective procedures for promotion of quality and reduction of risk (This risk is breaking IP law!) + 5.11 Not ask a software engineer to do anything inconsistent with this Code (copy code) + 8.08 Not influenced others to undertake any action that involves a breach of the Code By right, the team leader should: + 6.12 Express concerns to the people involved when significant violations of this Code are detected Therefore, they both should go find out about the legality issues with Open Source, because they should: + 8.05 Improve their knowledge of relevant standards and the law governing the software and related documents on which they work, question 7 workflow # scenario # The SmartSolutions software company had a contract with a transportation company, TransCo, to add a new component to their existing scheduling tool. The new component was to be a smart reasoning component for recommending routes to drivers. After the first version was delivered, TransCo decided that the new component would have to ==contain more features== to allow maximum flexibility for users (\u201cevent 1\u201d). After incorporating these and the second version was delivered, SmartSolutions found out that the company producing the constraint solver library that it was using had gone broke, so it needed to ==change the design== to use a different library(\u201cevent 2\u201d). Then SmartSolutions realized its own analysts had misunderstood one of TransCo\u2019s requirements, so they had to ==re-do some of the analysis== (\u201cevent 3\u201d). Below is an \u201cempty\u201d depiction of the Unified Process. Extend the figure to represent (roughly) the relative effort given to the different workflows during this project.

She replied: We follow the Unified Process to make sure we develop the right product in the right way. The process consists of five distinct workflows. We complete all the tasks and confirm all the documentations in each workflow before we move on to the next workflow. (waterfall plan driven\u53ea\u6709\u7eb5\u5411\u6ca1\u6709 \u6a2a\u5411) The first workflow is the Requirements Workflow, where we brainstorm ideas about features that our customers will love to have. The next workflow is the Analysis Workflow. This involves analysing the problem domain more deeply and describing the requirements in the kind of exacting detail that developers need. Typically, in this workflow we will produce conceptual class diagrams,detailed use case scenarios, interaction diagrams and statecharts. Once the Analysis Workflow is completed, we begin the Design Workflow, where we refine the conceptual class diagram into something more concrete, producing a detailed class diagram. The next workflow of the process is the Implementation Workflow. In this workflow, we write the code to implement the detailed class diagram produced in the previous workflow. Finally, we will have the Test Workflow, where we test our program to ensure that the system works correctly.

From the CTO description, the company process is therefore too similar to traditional waterfall model \u2013step by step \u2013 one workflow after another is like one phase after another.
