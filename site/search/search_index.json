The controller will received the user's command and return the result to the VIEW Which functionality/files in each component of MVC? # Model: + database + Defines the data validation rules + contains code that defines its relationship with other models Controller: + Controls the application flow or logic of the application + decides what response is to be generated and passes the response (output) to the view + calls to model to access data View: + View is the outputs or responses that are sent back to the user once a request is processed + the presentation layer of an application + Razor View in .net What is Model? Functionality? Responsibilities? # A class or set of classes that describes all the business logic and additionally handles data access for an application. Also contains code that defines its relationship with other models . Defines the data validation rules to be used when adding or updating data. What is Controller? Functionality? Responsibilities? # Controllers are the components that handle user interaction, work with the model, and ultimately select a view to render. Controls the application flow or logic of the application Controller logic decides what response is to be generated Controller logic normally contains calls to models to access data , and also other functionalities like access control checks etc Controller passes the response (output) to the view What is View? Functionality? Responsibilities? # presenting content through the user interface. They use the Razor view engine to embed .NET code in HTML markup. Consist of markup (like HTML) code with embedded .NET code. Can also be other forms of output like XML, PDF documents etc. Views can be thought of as the presentation layer of an application and ideally should be as \"dumb\" as possible \u2605\u2605 Advantages of ASP.NET MVC = Why use MVC? = MVC benefit # Enables the full control over the rendered HTML (\u524d\u7aef\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u903b\u8f91) Provides clean separation of concerns(SoC).

A concern can be as general as the details of the hardware the code is being optimized for, or as specific as the name of a class to instantiate. The value of separation of concerns is simplifying development and maintenance of computer programs. When concerns are well-separated, individual sections can be reused, as well as developed and updated independently. For example, user interface logic tends to change more frequently than business logic. If presentation code and business logic are combined in a single object, an object containing business logic must be modified every time the user interface is changed Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) \u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5982\u4f55\u5212\u5206 class\uff0c reuse # The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer-programming principle that states that every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part.
